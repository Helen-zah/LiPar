# LiPar

LiPar is a lightweight parallel learning model for practical in-vehicle network intrusion detection. LiPar has great detection performance, running efficiency, and lightweight model size, which can be well adapted to the in-vehicle environment practically and protect the in-vehicle CAN bus security.

You can see the details in our paper **LiPar: A Lightweight Parallel Learning Model for Practical In-Vehicle Network Intrusion Detection**. (The link is on the way...)

## The Dataset

The dataset we used is [Car-Hacking Dataset](https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Datasets/car-hacking-dataset) (you can fine the details of this dataset by the link). We also upload the data files in `./OriginalDataset/`. Due to the limitation of upload file size, we compressed each data file into a `.rar` file. You can get the original data by unzipping the files. 

## The Data Processing

The codes for data processing are uploaded in `./DataProcessing/`.
